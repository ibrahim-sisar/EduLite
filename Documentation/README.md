## ✨ Vision

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, I (the founder) was still young and found platforms like Microsoft Teams hard to use and slow. In 2023, a war broke out in Gaza and disconnected us from school for more than a year.

That’s when I asked:

> **“Why aren’t we building something made for students?”**

So I decided to build one — with you.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- ✅ Real-time messaging (Students ↔ Teachers)
- ✅ Assignment & exam creation and submission
- 🔒 Smart anti-cheating system
- 📅 Lecture scheduling & calendar integration
- 🎥 Google Meet integration
- 🧠 Clean, age-friendly UI

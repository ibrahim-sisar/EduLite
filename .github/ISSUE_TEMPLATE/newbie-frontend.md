## **üéØ Goal / Objective**

*Concisely describe what the contributor will achieve by completing this task. What is the main aim of this task?*
*(Example: To implement a visual s√©paration line between sections on the homepage for better readability.)*

## **üìù Task Description / Requirements**

*Provide a clear, step-by-step description of what needs to be done. Be specific about the expected outcome and any acceptance criteria.*

*(Example:*

1. Locate the `Home.jsx` component in `Frontend/EduLiteFrontend/src/pages/`.
2. Between the "About and Features" section and the "Open Source Section", add a horizontal rule (`<hr />`) or a styled `<div>` to act as a visual separator.
3. Ensure the separator is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
4. The separator should respect the dark mode theme (e.g., have a suitable color in both light and dark modes).
5. Verify that the change does not negatively impact the layout of other elements on the page.)*

## **‚ú® Benefits / Why this helps EduLite**

*Explain how completing this task will benefit the EduLite project, its contributors, or its users.*
*(Example: This will improve the visual organization of the homepage, making it easier for users to distinguish between different content sections. It also offers a good opportunity for a new contributor to get familiar with our frontend codebase and styling conventions.)*

## **üõ†Ô∏è Skills Required**

*List the specific skills or technologies the contributor will need or will get a chance to practice. Be encouraging!*
*(Example:*
* *Basic understanding of React functional components.*
* *HTML (for adding the element).*
* *CSS / Tailwind CSS (for styling the separator and ensuring responsiveness/dark mode compatibility).*
* *Familiarity with Git and GitHub for creating a branch and submitting a pull request (we can help with this!).)*

## **üìö Helpful Resources / Getting Started**

*Provide links to relevant documentation, files in the codebase, or sections of the contribution guide that might help a beginner get started. Point them to where they can ask questions.*
*(Example:*
* *EduLite Frontend README: `Frontend/README.md`*
* *Relevant Component: `Frontend/EduLiteFrontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` (based on the example description)*
* *Tailwind CSS Documentation: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)*
* *EduLite Contributing Guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`*
* *Feel free to ask questions in our Discord server's #frontend channel!)*

## **üíª Files to be Altered or Created (if known)**

*List any specific files or directories within the frontend codebase that you believe will need to be modified or created. If unsure, this can be an estimate.*
*(Example: `Frontend/EduLiteFrontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`)*

## **üí° Additional Context / Tips (Optional)**

*Add any other helpful context, tips for approaching the problem, or screenshots of the current state/desired state. This is a good place for encouragement!*
*(Example: "Don't worry if you're new to Tailwind CSS; its utility classes are quite intuitive! You can test your changes locally using `npm run dev` as described in the Frontend README. We appreciate your help!")*
